# hiragana_practice
Simple terminal script that I used to memorize writing the Japanese hiragana alphabet.

Run it like a normal python script.

Takes input as the enter key.
Outputs a romaji(latin alphabet) spelling of a random, made-up Japanese word and asks you to convert it to hiragana.
On Enter Key again, reveals the answer.
